   <h1>About Reed's Bitcoin Classroom</h1>
   <p>Bitcoin Classroom was started in January 2024 with a mission of bringing new skills to local Bitcoiners. Bitcoin Classroom wants to spread practical, hands-on Bitcoin knowledge to Bitcoiners who learn better in a classroom environment, as opposed to self-taught from YouTube or other online resources.</p>
   <p>Our model is to provide computers, hardware wallets, or other physical devices and allow students to actually use them and set them up in a classroom setting. Students come to Bitcoin Classroom to learn and will never set up wallets that they will actually send actual Bitcoin to.</p>
   <p>Our first two classes are a Multisig-101 and a Multisig-201 class. In the Multisig-101 class, even students with no prior Bitcoin knowledge can set up and use a 2-of-3 multisig wallet in Sparrow. In the Multisig-201 class, students will focus on restoring multisig wallets in a variety of ways, including using different software programs and different combinations of keys.</p>
   <p>In the future, we will have a class on setting up a Start9 Node, and students will have the option of paying for the hardware and taking it home! We will also have a similar option for our Bitcoin mining class in the future.</p>
